    For most users, Home Assistant will automatically discover and add the Airlytix sensor, thanks to ESPHome's mDNS discovery.

    To add it to Home Assistant, go to 'Settings', then 'Devices and Services'. Here, the Airlytix ES1 should be automatically discovered. Click the 'Configure' button to add it to Home Assistant.
