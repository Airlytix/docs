# Getting started with Airlytix

This section walks you through getting your Airlytix ES1 ready to use:

- Assembling or confirming the hardware
- Connecting it to your WiFi network
- Adding it to Home Assistant so you can see readings and control the indicator light

Before you begin, you will need:

- A 2.4 GHz WiFi network and password
- A Home Assistant instance (for integration)
- A computer or mobile device with a modern browser (Chrome or Edge recommended for the web installer)

Most units arrive fully assembled. If yours already looks like the product render, you can usually skip the detailed assembly guide and start with WiFi and Home Assistant.
