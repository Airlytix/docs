# Getting Started with Airlytix: Connecting to WiFi

Connecting your Airlytix sensor to your WiFi network is a crucial first step. You can choose from three methods to achieve this connection.

ES1 connects to **2.4 GHz** WiFi networks only. Dual‑band routers with a single SSID are usually fine; very old 5 GHz‑only networks are not supported.

For most users, we recommend trying the options in this order:

- **Using Your Browser** – easiest if you have a computer with Chrome or Edge and a USB cable.
- **Via Airlytix WiFi Hotspot** – best if you prefer using a phone/tablet and do not want to connect by USB.
- **Using Home Assistant Bluetooth** – useful if your Home Assistant installation has Bluetooth and you want to provision over BLE.

    You are done when the installer reports success and the device restarts. After a short time, ES1 should appear in Home Assistant for integration.

    If the installer reports success but ES1 does not appear in Home Assistant after a few minutes, double‑check that the WiFi name and password were entered correctly and that your Home Assistant instance is on the same network.
