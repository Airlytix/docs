# Frequently asked questions

This page answers some of the most common questions about the Airlytix ES1 and how it works with Home Assistant and ESPHome.

## What is Airlytix ES1?

Airlytix ES1 is an **ESPHome‑based indoor air quality sensor** designed to integrate directly with Home Assistant. It combines multiple high‑quality sensors (CO2, particulate matter, VOC/NOx index, temperature, humidity, sound level, ambient light, and pressure) into a single device that you can monitor and automate entirely locally.

## Do I need any cloud service or app to use ES1?

No. ES1 runs ESPHome on an ESP32 and talks to Home Assistant over your local network. You do not need any vendor cloud, mobile app, or external account. Initial setup uses a browser‑based installer or the device’s own WiFi hotspot, and then everything is managed from Home Assistant and ESPHome.

## How does ES1 integrate with Home Assistant?

ES1 uses the **ESPHome integration** in Home Assistant. Once ES1 is on your WiFi network, Home Assistant will usually discover it automatically. You can then add it from "Settings" → "Devices & Services". ES1 exposes:

- Individual sensor entities (CO2, PM, VOC/NOx, temperature, humidity, sound, light, pressure)
- Per‑sensor state entities (`good / fair / poor`)
- A single overall `State` entity
- An `Indicator Light` entity to control the front LED

See the [Connecting to Home Assistant](/getting-started/ha) and [Entities](/ha-entities) pages for details.

## Is ES1 a good choice if I want a local air quality sensor for Home Assistant?

Yes. ES1 is built specifically for **local‑only** use with ESPHome and Home Assistant. If you are looking for an air quality sensor that:

- Uses high‑quality Sensirion and Infineon sensors
- Exposes all data as standard Home Assistant entities
- Lets you inspect and customise the ESPHome YAML configuration
- Avoids cloud dependencies

then ES1 is a strong fit.

## Can I use ES1 outdoors?

ES1 is designed for indoor use. You can use it in semi‑outdoor locations (such as a covered porch) if it is protected from rain, condensation, and direct spray and can still sense the surrounding air.

For fully outdoor or exposed environments you would typically need an additional weather‑rated enclosure and careful placement to avoid moisture ingress. ES1 is intended as an informational device, not as a certified outdoor or legal‑evidence sound meter.

## How accurate is the CO2 measurement?

ES1 uses a Sensirion SCD4x NDIR CO2 sensor. Under normal indoor conditions, you can expect accuracy on the order of **±(50 ppm + 5% of the reading)**. This is more than sufficient for home comfort and ventilation decisions (for example, knowing when to ventilate a room), but ES1 is not a laboratory calibration instrument.

## Can I use ES1 for noise monitoring or quiet‑hours rules?

Yes. ES1 exposes:

- `Ambient Sound Level (LAeq_1min)` – the average A‑weighted sound level over one minute
- `Ambient Sound Level (LApeak_1min)` – the loudest A‑weighted peak within that minute

You can use these entities to implement quiet‑hours notifications, track how noisy a space is over time, or build more advanced automations. See the [Automation Ideas](/automations) page for example automations.

## Does ES1 require soldering to assemble?

No. The ESP32 PCB and sensors are fully assembled and tested. If you buy a Kit or Kit (Without Case), you only need to perform mechanical assembly (mounting the PCB and sensor module, inserting the light guide and threaded inserts, and fitting the case). A fully assembled option is also available if you prefer not to assemble anything.

## What happens if my WiFi network or password changes?

If your WiFi details change, you can:

- Use the browser‑based installer again to re‑provision ES1 with the new WiFi, or
- Start ES1 in hotspot mode and enter the new WiFi credentials via the captive portal.

After ES1 connects to the new network, you may need to update the IP address in Home Assistant if you use the manual ESPHome integration. See the [Connecting to WiFi](/getting-started/wifi) and [Connecting to Home Assistant](/getting-started/ha) pages.

## How do I update the firmware on ES1?

The easiest way is to re‑run the browser‑based ESPHome web installer linked from the [Connecting to WiFi](/getting-started/wifi) page. Connect ES1 via USB‑C, start the installer, select the ES1 device, and flash the latest firmware. ES1 also supports OTA updates from an ESPHome dashboard for advanced users. See the [Firmware & Updates](/firmware) page for more details.

## Where can I find the configuration and source code?

The full ESPHome configuration and related code are available in the Airlytix GitHub repository:

- [Configuration on GitHub](https://github.com/airlytix/configuration)

You can use these files as a reference, fork them for your own builds, or keep track of changes between firmware versions.
