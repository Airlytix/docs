# Firmware & updates

ES1 runs ESPHome‑based firmware that can be updated over time. This page explains how firmware updates work and how you can safely keep your device up to date.

## How ES1 firmware is delivered

- ES1 uses ESPHome with over‑the‑air (OTA) updates enabled.
- The official ES1 configuration is published in the Airlytix configuration repository.
- The browser‑based installer is linked from the [Connecting to WiFi](/getting-started/wifi) page under the **Using Your Browser** tab.

You do not need to manage YAML or build firmware yourself unless you want to customise ES1 beyond the stock configuration.

## Checking your firmware version

In Home Assistant:

- Open the ES1 device page.
- Look for the firmware or ESPHome version in the device info panel (this may appear under the ESPHome integration).

You can also see details in the ESPHome logs if you have the ESPHome dashboard connected to your ES1.

## Updating ES1 using the web installer

The simplest way to update ES1 is to re‑run the browser installer described on the [Connecting to WiFi](/getting-started/wifi) page:

1. Connect ES1 to your computer with a USB‑C cable.
2. Open the **Using Your Browser** tab on the [Connecting to WiFi](/getting-started/wifi) page.
3. Click the connect button to launch the ESPHome web installer.
4. Choose the ES1 device (CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller) when prompted.
5. Select the latest ES1 firmware and start the install.
6. When prompted, enter your WiFi details again.

After a successful flash, ES1 restarts with the new firmware and reconnects to your WiFi.

## Updating over the air (OTA)

If you manage ES1 from ESPHome directly:

- ES1 exposes the ESPHome API and OTA update endpoint.
- From the ESPHome dashboard, you can push a new build to ES1 without using USB.

This path is intended for advanced users who maintain their own ESPHome environment.

## When to update

- If you are happy with ES1’s behaviour, you do not need to update frequently.
- Updates are most useful when:
  - New sensors or metrics are added.
  - Threshold defaults or algorithms are improved.
  - Bug fixes for connectivity or stability are released.

Check the Airlytix project release notes or repository for a summary of changes when a new firmware version is published.

## Resetting configuration to defaults

If you have changed many ranges or offsets and want to return to defaults:

- You can manually set thresholds and offsets back to the values in the [Configuration](/ha-configuration) page.
- Or you can install the latest firmware again using the web installer:
  - This reapplies the stock configuration, but you will need to re‑enter WiFi details and re‑add ES1 to Home Assistant if the device name changes.

Before making large changes, consider taking a Home Assistant backup so you can restore your automations and settings if needed.
